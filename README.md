# 🌐 WebRelic-Portfolio-Dec-2024

Welcome to my **WebRelic Portfolio** — this is my old portfolio website code from December 2024.  
I’ve kept this repository for archival and reference purposes.

## 📁 About this repository

- This project contains the full source code of my **previous portfolio website**.  
- It’s kept here as a relic 🏺 of my past work and growth as a developer.  
- I currently maintain **two other portfolios**, so this one is no longer actively maintained.
